# Plant-Disease-Detection
 Resnet - 152 pre-trained model detector  to  successfully recognize different categories of diseases in various plant leaves with an accuracy of 96.29%.
An accuracy
of 96.29% using Resnet - 152 pre-trained model was achieved. It was able to score 93.05% accuracy in the training phrase under 10 epochs with the learning rate of 0.001.Model is able to achieve an accuracy of 96.29% for testing data. Resnet-based detector is able to successfully recognize different categories of diseases in various plant leaves. 

According to the Food and Agriculture organization of the United Nations (UN), transboundary plant pests and diseases affect food crops, causing significant losses to farmers and threatening food security.

Plant diseases contribute 10–16% losses in the global harvest of crops each year costing an estimated US$220 billion. According to a report of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), our world population is anticipated to hit 9.1 billion in 2050. Therefore, agricultural production needs to be increased up to 70% to fulfill the food requirements of a steadily growing population. On the other hand, abundant use of chemicals such as bactericides, fungicides, and nematicides to control plant diseases has been causing adverse effects in the agro-ecosystem. Currently, there is a need for effective early disease detection techniques to control plant diseases for food security and sustainability of agro-ecosystem.

The spread of transboundary plant pests and diseases has increased dramatically in recent years. Globalization, trade and climate change, as well as reduced resilience in production systems due to decades of agricultural intensification, have all played a part.

Transboundary plant pests and diseases can easily spread to several countries and reach epidemic proportions. Outbreaks and upsurges can cause huge losses to crops and pastures, threatening the livelihoods of vulnerable farmers and the food and nutrition security of millions at a time.

The project is broken down into multiple steps:

Load and preprocess the image dataset
Train the image classifier on your dataset
Use the trained classifier to predict image content
